Hello World, This is my first project on GitHub
I am a recent graduate from the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, and i have a Bachelors Degree in Information Technology. I love gaming and play a game called Valorant. In this game i have reached the rank of radiant which only the top 500 people can reach in a region like North America, Europe, etc. I love learning via internet and hope i can leverage that ability to code and get a job in software development.
